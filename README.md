# JavaScript Objects - Class and Homework Assignment

Welcome to the **JavaScript Objects** class! This repository contains the materials and homework assignments for learning how to work with objects in JavaScript. 
The goal of this project is to help you practice declaring, manipulating, and updating JavaScript objects.

## Overview

In this lesson, we learned the basics of **JavaScript Objects**:

- **Declaring Objects** using key-value pairs
- **Accessing Object Properties** using dot and bracket notation
- **Nested Objects**
- **Using Arrays within Objects**
- **For-In Loop** for iterating over object properties

## Homework Overview

For this homework, you will practice applying these concepts by updating a **character object** from an MMO game, **Ultima Online**. 
You will need to make several modifications to the object to simulate an update process for a game character.

### Character Object

You are given the following object representing a character named **Shay**:

```javascript
let shay = {
    name: "Ark", 
    class: "Lumberjack",
    title: "Grandmaster",
    stats: {
        strength: 100,
        stamina: 100, 
        mana: 25,
    },
};
